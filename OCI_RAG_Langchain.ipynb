       "   'summary': \"Solaris is a proprietary Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems. After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in 2010, it was renamed Oracle Solaris.Solaris superseded the company's earlier SunOS in 1993, and became known for its scalability, especially on SPARC systems, and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider. \\nSolaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors. Solaris was registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification until 29 April 2019.Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. With OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as Illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions.

Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format –  8-bit.UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid Unicode code points using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.\\nUTF-8 was designed as a superior alternative to UTF-1, a proposed variable-length encoding with partial ASCII compatibility which lacked some features including self-synchronization and fully ASCII-compatible handling of characters such as slashes. Ken Thompson and Rob Pike produced the first implementation for the Plan 9 operating system in September 1992. This led to its adoption by X/Open as its specification for FSS-UTF, which would first be officially presented at USENIX in January 1993 and subsequently adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 2277 (BCP 18) for future internet standards work, replacing Single Byte Character Sets such as Latin-1 in older RFCs.\\nUTF-8 results in fewer internationalization issues than any alternative text encoding, and it has been implemented in all modern operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, and standards such as JSON, where, as is increasingly the case, it is the only allowed form of Unicode.\\nUTF-8 is the dominant encoding for the World Wide Web (and internet technologies), accounting for 98.2% of all web pages, 99.0% of the top 10,000 pages, and up to 100%  for many languages, as of 2024.

The SaaS offering is designed to provide support in one platform for employees and organizations during an employee's entire career, from hiring to career development to retiring. It can be accessed on and used across multiple devices, and was released as a module of Oracle Fusion applications in October 2011. Oracle developed Fusion infrastructure to support its cloud HCM (Human Capital Management) application, as well as its CRM (Customer Relationship Management); Financials; Governance, Risk, and Compliance; Procurement; Project Portfolio Management; and SCM (Supply Chain Management) cloud applications.In December 2004, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft. Oracle integrated intellectual property and knowledge of HR from PeopleSoft into HCM Cloud.In February 2012, Oracle acquired Taleo Corporation, integrating Taleo's Talent Management Cloud into Oracle's human resources management system (HRMS) application product.In February 2014, Oracle released HCM Cloud 8, which made changes to social sourcing, time and attendance, workforce modeling, performance management, and succession planning components.By 2015, Oracle's core HRMS and payroll ran completely on the cloud, and the company was building new Cloud HCM apps on mobile first to support an integrated mobile experience. These included life/work apps for employee wellness management, reputation management, and competitions.In January 2018, Office Depot started using Oracle HCM as its HR/talent management platform. In October of that year, Oracle added third-party tie-ins for LinkedIn Talent Solutions and My Brand tools to HCM Cloud.In 2019, HCM Cloud was chosen by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of its HR system.In 2021, Oracle upgraded the platform to use low-code/no-code tools. It also introduced its Dynamic Skills platform capability which uses AI to catalog skills and suggest ways that employees and businesses as a whole can leverage skills.\\n\\n\\n== Talent and workforce management ==\\nCompanies can use Cloud HCM workforce modeling and prediction tools to predict possible hiring and reorganization needs. There are: a benefits portal that allows employees to sign up for their own benefits, a talent management tool that supports talent acquisition (recruiting) and retention, and learning modules that allow individuals to create and share different classes. Cloud HCM also offers LinkedIn Talent Solutions tie-ins and My Brand tools to support employee collaboration and help employees find career development opportunities.In 2021, Oracle released a tool called Oracle Dynamic Skills to help companies manage employee skills and identify skill gaps. The set of tools is made up of three major components: Skills Nexus, which uses AI to define and store skills profiles; Skills Advisor, a recommendation engine for skills across the talent business process that uses data about the employee and/or candidate; and Skills Center, a portal for employees to identify their skills and explore career growth opportunities.\\n\\n\\n== Human resources (HR) ==\\nThe Oracle Human Resources module within Oracle HCM includes some of the following capabilities:\\nWorkforce modeling and prediction tools powered by data intelligence\\nContextual compensation metrics\\nEmployee benefits portal\\nLow code/no-code tools for HR templates creation\\nHR help desk\\nComprehensive onboarding process\\nWork life portal to increase employee engagement and wellness\\nIntegrated employee directory to encourage collaboration\\nAI-powered digital assistantHR administrators can restrict users' access to information based on their location; use configurable, rule-based action lists to manage policies for represented workers;\",\n",

       "  'In database computing, Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) — an option for the Oracle Database software produced by Oracle Corporation and introduced in 2001 with Oracle9i — provides software for clustering and high availability in Oracle database environments. Oracle Corporation includes RAC with the Enterprise Edition, provided the nodes are clustered using Oracle Clusterware.\\n\\n\\n== Functionality ==\\nOracle RAC allows multiple computers to run Oracle RDBMS software simultaneously while accessing a single database, thus providing clustering.\\nIn a non-RAC Oracle database, a single instance accesses a single database.  The database consists of a collection of data files, control files, and redo logs located on disk. The instance comprises the collection of Oracle-related memory and background processes that run on a computer system.\\nIn an Oracle RAC environment, 2 or more instances concurrently access a single database. This allows an application or user to connect to either computer and have access to a single coordinated set of data. The instances are connected with each other through an \"Interconnect\" which enables all the instances to be in sync in accessing the data.\\n\\n\\n== Aims ==\\nThe main aim of Oracle RAC is to implement a clustered database to provide performance, scalability and resilience & high availability of data at  instance level.\\n\\n\\n== Implementation ==\\nOracle RAC depends on the infrastructure component Oracle Clusterware to coordinate multiple servers and their sharing of data storage.\\nThe FAN (Fast Application Notification) technology detects down-states.\\nRAC administrators can use the srvctl tool to manage RAC configurations,\\n\\n\\n=== Cache Fusion ===\\nPrior to Oracle 9, network-clustered Oracle databases used a storage device as the data-transfer medium (meaning that one node would write a data block to disk and another node would read that data from the same disk), which had the inherent disadvantage of lackluster performance. Oracle 9i addressed this issue: RAC uses a dedicated network connection for communications internal to the cluster.\\nSince all computers/instances in a RAC access the same database, the overall system must guarantee the coordination of data changes on different computers such that whenever a computer queries data, it receives the current version — even if another computer recently modified that data. Oracle RAC refers to this functionality as Cache Fusion. Cache Fusion involves the ability of Oracle RAC to \"fuse\" the in-memory data cached physically separately on each computer into a single, global cache.\\n\\n\\n=== Networking ===\\nThe Oracle Grid Naming Service (GNS) handles name resolution in the cluster registry.\\n\\n\\n=== Diagnostics ===\\nThe Trace File Analyzer (TFA) aids in collecting RAC diagnostic data.\\n\\n\\n== Versions ==\\nOracle Real Application Clusters 12c Release 1 Enterprise Edition.\\nOracle Real Application Clusters One Node (RAC One Node) applies RAC to single-node installations running Oracle Database 11g Release 2 Enterprise Edition.\\n\\n\\n== Evolution ==\\nRelative to the single-instance Oracle database, Oracle RAC adds additional complexity. While database automation makes sense for single-instance databases, it becomes even more necessary for clustered databases because of their increased complexity.\\nOracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), introduced with Oracle 9i in 2001, supersedes the Oracle Parallel Server (OPS) database option. Whereas Oracle9i required an external clusterware (known as vendor clusterware like TruCluster Veritas Cluster Server or Sun Cluster) for most of the Unix flavors (except for Linux and Windows where Oracle provided free clusterware called Cluster Ready Services or CRS), as of Oracle 10g, Oracle\\'s clusterware product was available for all operating systems. With the release of Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (10.2), Cluster Ready Services was renamed to Oracle Clusterware.

After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in 2010, it was renamed Oracle Solaris.Solaris superseded the company's earlier SunOS in 1993, and became known for its scalability, especially on SPARC systems, and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider. \\nSolaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors. Solaris was registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification until 29 April 2019.Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. With OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as Illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions. In September 2017, Oracle laid off most of the Solaris teams.In 2011, the Solaris 11 kernel source code leaked. Through the Oracle Technology Network (OTN), industry partners can gain access to the in-development Solaris source code. Solaris is developed under a proprietary development model, and only the source for open-source components of Solaris 11 is available for download from Oracle.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 1987, AT&T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: Berkeley Software Distribution, UNIX System V, and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix, SunOS 4, with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as SunOS 5, but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: Solaris 2. The justification for this new overbrand was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality.\\nAlthough SunOS 4.1.x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris 1 by Sun, the Solaris name is used almost exclusively to refer only to the releases based on SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.For releases based on SunOS 5, the SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number. For example, Solaris 2.4 incorporates SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6, the 2. was dropped from the release name, so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7, and the latest release SunOS 5.11 forms the core of Solaris 11.4.\\nAlthough SunSoft stated in its initial Solaris 2 press release their intent to eventually support both SPARC and x86 systems, the first two Solaris 2 releases, 2.0 and 2.1, were SPARC-only. An x86 version of Solaris 2.1 was released in June 1993, about 6 months after the SPARC version, as a desktop and uniprocessor workgroup server operating system. It included the Wabi emulator to support Windows applications. At the time, Sun also offered the Interactive Unix system that it had acquired from Interactive Systems Corporation. In 1994, Sun released Solaris 2.4, supporting both SPARC and x86 systems from a unified source code base.\\nOn September 2, 2017, Simon Phipps, a former Sun Microsystems employee not hired by Oracle in the acquisition, reported on Twitter that Oracle had laid off the Solaris core development staff, which many interpreted as sign that Oracle no longer intended to support future development of the platform. While Oracle did have a large layoff of Solaris development engineering staff, development continued and Solaris 11.4 was released in 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Supported architectures ==\\nSolaris uses a common code base\",\n",

He was Oracle\\'s chief executive officer from 1977 to 2014 and is now its chief technology officer and executive chairman.\\nAs of March 2024, he is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of US$130 billion, and the fifth-wealthiest in the world according to Forbes, with an estimated net worth of $154 billion. Ellison is also known for his ownership of 98% of Lānaʻi, the sixth-largest island in the Hawaiian Islands.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nEllison was born on August 17, 1944, in New York City to Florence Spellman, an unwed Jewish mother. His biological father was an Italian-American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.Ellison moved to Chicago\\'s South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother, Lillian Spellman Ellison, as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chosen the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration. Ellison states: \"While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don\\'t believe that they are real. They\\'re interesting stories. They\\'re interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don\\'t. I see no evidence for this stuff.\" Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.Ellison attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and was enrolled as a premed student. At the university, he was named science student of the year. He withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California, he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he studied physics and mathematics and also first encountered computer design. He then moved to Berkeley, California and began his career as a computer programmer for different companies.\\n\\n\\n== Early career and Oracle ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1977–1994 ===\\nDuring the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His projects included a database for the CIA, which he named \"Oracle\". Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\". In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.In 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc. Ellison had heard about the IBM System R database, also based on Codd\\'s theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R\\'s code. The initial release of the Oracle Database in 1979 was called Oracle version 2; there was no Oracle version 1. In 1983, the company officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product. In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money.

Active successor projects include LibreOffice (the most actively developed), Apache OpenOffice and Collabora Online.\\nOpenOffice was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice, which Sun Microsystems acquired in 1999 for internal use. Sun open-sourced the OpenOffice suite in July 2000 as a competitor to Microsoft Office, releasing version 1.0 on 1 May 2002.OpenOffice included a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation application (Impress), a drawing application (Draw), a formula editor (Math), and a database management application (Base). Its default file format was the OpenDocument Format (ODF), an ISO/IEC standard, which originated with OpenOffice.org. It could also read a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office. OpenOffice.org was primarily developed for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Solaris, and later for OS X, with ports to other operating systems. It was distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPL); early versions were also available under the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL).\\nIn 2011, Oracle Corporation, the then-owner of Sun, announced that it would no longer offer a commercial version of the suite and donated the project to the Apache Foundation. Apache renamed the software Apache OpenOffice.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nOpenOffice.org originated as StarOffice, a proprietary office suite developed by German company Star Division from 1985 on. In August 1999, Star Division was acquired by Sun Microsystems for US$59.5 million, as it was supposedly cheaper than licensing Microsoft Office for 42,000 staff.On 19 July 2000 at OSCON, Sun Microsystems announced it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software and of providing a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office. The new project was known as OpenOffice.org, and the code was released as open source on 13 October 2000. The first public preview release was Milestone Build 638c, released in October 2001 (which quickly achieved 1 million downloads); the final release of OpenOffice.org 1.0 was on 1 May 2002.OpenOffice.org became the standard office suite on many Linux distros and spawned many derivative versions. It quickly became noteworthy competition to Microsoft Office, achieving 14% penetration in the large enterprise market by 2004.The OpenOffice.org XML file format – XML in a ZIP archive, easily machine-processable – was intended by Sun to become a standard interchange format for office documents, to replace the different binary formats for each application that had been usual until then. Sun submitted the format to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) in 2002 and it was adapted to form the OpenDocument standard in 2005, which was ratified as ISO 26300 in 2006. It was made OpenOffice.org's native format from version 2 on. Many governments and other organisations adopted OpenDocument, particularly given there was a free implementation of it readily available.\\nDevelopment of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun (and then Oracle), in support of the StarOffice business model. This was controversial for many years. An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL) was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base.After acquiring Sun in January 2010, Oracle Corporation continued developing OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, which it renamed Oracle Open Office, though with a reduction in assigned developers.

       "  'UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding standard used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format –  8-bit.UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid Unicode code points using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.\\nUTF-8 was designed as a superior alternative to UTF-1, a proposed variable-length encoding with partial ASCII compatibility which lacked some features including self-synchronization and fully ASCII-compatible handling of characters such as slashes. Ken Thompson and Rob Pike produced the first implementation for the Plan 9 operating system in September 1992. This led to its adoption by X/Open as its specification for FSS-UTF, which would first be officially presented at USENIX in January 1993 and subsequently adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 2277 (BCP 18) for future internet standards work, replacing Single Byte Character Sets such as Latin-1 in older RFCs.\\nUTF-8 results in fewer internationalization issues than any alternative text encoding, and it has been implemented in all modern operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, and standards such as JSON, where, as is increasingly the case, it is the only allowed form of Unicode.\\nUTF-8 is the dominant encoding for the World Wide Web (and internet technologies), accounting for 98.2% of all web pages, 99.0% of the top 10,000 pages, and up to 100%  for many languages, as of 2024. Virtually all countries and languages have 95% or more use of UTF-8 encodings on the web.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nThe official name for the encoding is UTF-8, the spelling used in all Unicode Consortium documents. Most standards officially list it in upper case as well, but all that do are also case-insensitive and utf-8 is often used in code.Some other spellings may also be accepted by standards, e.g. web standards (which include CSS, HTML, XML, and HTTP headers) explicitly allow utf8 (and disallow \"unicode\") and many aliases for encodings. Spellings with a space e.g. \"UTF 8\" should not be used. The official Internet Assigned Numbers Authority also lists csUTF8 as the only alias, which is rarely used.\\nIn Windows, UTF-8 is codepage 65001 (i.e. CP_UTF8 in source code).\\nIn MySQL, UTF-8 is called utf8mb4 (with utf8mb3, and its alias utf8, being a subset encoding for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane). In HP PCL, the Symbol-ID for UTF-8 is 18N.In Oracle Database (since version 9.0), AL32UTF8 means UTF-8. See also CESU-8 for an almost synonym with UTF-8 that rarely should be used.\\nUTF-8-BOM and UTF-8-NOBOM are sometimes used for text files which contain or do not contain a byte-order mark (BOM), respectively. In Japan especially, UTF-8 encoding without a BOM is sometimes called UTF-8N.\\n\\n\\n== Encoding ==\\nUTF-8 encodes code points in one to four bytes, depending on the value of the code point. In the following table, the x characters are replaced by the bits of the code point:\\n\\nThe first 128 code points (ASCII) need one byte. The next 1,920 code points need two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets, and also IPA extensions, Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana and N\\'Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks. Three bytes are needed for the remaining 61,440 code points of the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters. Four bytes are needed for the 1,048,576 code points in the other planes of Unicode, which include emoji (pictographic symbols), less common CJK characters, various historic script',\n",

Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet. It went public in 1986. Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company's software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005 from $245.1 million in 1997.Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies, and wellness programs.In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company and Patterson became the company's president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.

After having been transferred to Eclipse, GlassFish remained dual-licensed, but the CDDL license was replaced by the Eclipse Public License (EPL).\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nGlassFish is the Eclipse implementation of Jakarta EE (formerly the reference implementation from Oracle) and as such supports Jakarta REST, Jakarta CDI, Jakarta Security, Jakarta Persistence, Jakarta Transactions, Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Faces, Jakarta Messaging, etc. This allows developers to create enterprise applications that are portable and scalable, and that integrate with legacy technologies. Optional components can also be installed for additional services.\\nBuilt on a modular kernel powered by OSGi, GlassFish runs straight on top of the Apache Felix implementation. It also runs with Equinox OSGi or Knopflerfish OSGi runtimes. HK2 abstracts the OSGi module system to provide components, which can also be viewed as services. Such services can be discovered and injected at runtime.\\nGlassFish is based on source code released by Sun and Oracle Corporation\\'s TopLink persistence system.

       "  'The Sun Ray was a stateless thin client computer (and associated software) aimed at corporate environments, originally introduced by Sun Microsystems in September 1999 and discontinued by Oracle Corporation in 2014. It featured a smart card reader and several models featured an integrated flat panel display.\\nThe idea of a stateless desktop was a significant shift from, and the eventual successor to, Sun\\'s earlier line of diskless Java-only desktops, the JavaStation.\\n\\n\\n== Predecessor ==\\nThe concept began in Sun Microsystems Laboratories in 1997 as a project codenamed NetWorkTerminal (NeWT). The client was designed to be small, low cost, low power, and silent. It was based on the Sun Microelectronics MicroSPARC IIep.  Other processors initially considered for it included Intel\\'s StrongARM, Philips Semiconductors\\' TriMedia, and National Semiconductor\\'s Geode. The MicroSPARC IIep was selected because of its high level of integration, good performance, low cost, and availability.\\nNeWT included 8 MiB of EDO DRAM and 4 MiB of NOR flash. The graphics controller used was the ATI Rage 128 because of its low power, 2D rendering performance, and low cost.  It also included an ATI video encoder for TV-out (removed in the Sun Ray 1), a Philips Semiconductor SAA7114 video decoder/scaler, Crystal Semiconductor audio CODEC, Sun Microelectronics Ethernet controller, PCI USB host interface with 4 port hub, and I²C smart card interface. The motherboard and daughtercard were housed in an off-the-shelf commercial small form-factor PC case with internal +12/+5VDC auto ranging power supply.\\nNeWT was designed to have feature parity with a modern business PC in every way possible. Instead of a commercial operating system. the client ran a real-time operating system called \"exec\", which was originally developed in Sun Labs as part of an Ethernet-based security camera project codenamed NetCam.  Less than 60 NeWTs were ever built and very few survived; one is in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.In July 2013, reports circulated that Oracle was ending the development of the Sun Ray and related products. Scott McNealy (long-time CEO of Sun) posted about this on Twitter. An official announcement was made on August 1, 2013, with the last order in February 2014. Support and hardware maintenance were available until 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\nIn contrast to a thick client, the Sun Ray is only a networked display device, with applications running on a server elsewhere, and the state of the user\\'s session being independent of the display.  This enables another feature of the Sun Ray; portable sessions where a user can go from one Sun Ray to another and continue their work without closing any programs. With a smart card, all the user had to do was insert the card and they would be presented with their session. Reauthentication requirements depend on the mode of operation. For example, without the smart card the procedure was almost identical, except the user must specify their username as well as password. In either case, if a session did not yet exist, a new one would be created the first time the user connects.\\nSun Ray clients are connected via an Ethernet network to a Sun Ray Server. Sun Ray Software (SRS) is available for the Solaris and Linux operating systems. Sun developed a separate network display protocol, Appliance Link Protocol (ALP), for the Sun Ray system.\\nVMware announced support for the protocol by VMware View in 2008.The Sun Ray Software has two basic modes of operation: generic session or kiosk mode. In a generic session, the user will see the Solaris or Linux login screen of the operating system that is running SRS.  In kiosk mode, the login screen varies depending on the session type in use. Kiosk mode can be used for a number of different desktop or applications. Oracle has integrated a RDP client, VMware View client into the Sun Ray software that can be used in Kiosk mode to start a full screen Windows sessi',\n",
       "  'Oracle Forms is a software product for creating screens that interact with an Oracle database.  It has an IDE that includes an object navigator, property sheet, and code editor that uses PL/SQL.  It was originally developed to run server-side in character-mode terminal sessions.  It was ported to other platforms, including Windows, to function in a client–server environment. Later versions were ported to Java where it runs in a Java EE container and can integrate with Java, and web services that can be launched from a URL.  Recent versions provide a means to run the forms from a desktop computer without requiring a browser.\\nThe primary focus of Forms is to create data entry systems that access an Oracle database.\\n\\n\\n== How it works ==\\nOracle Forms accesses the Oracle database and generates a screen that presents the data. The source form (*.fmb) is compiled into a platform-specific \"executable\" (*.fmx), that is run (interpreted) by the forms runtime module. The form is used to view and edit data in database-driven applications. Various GUI elements, such as buttons, menus, scrollbars, and graphics can be placed on the form.  Source code may also be placed in library files (*.pll) which are compiled into library executables (*.plx) used at runtime.\\nThe environment supplies built-in record creation, query, and update modes, each with its own default data manipulations. This minimizes the need to program common and tedious operations, such as creating dynamic SQL, sensing changed fields, and locking rows.\\nAs is normal with event driven interfaces, the software implements event-handling functions called triggers which are automatically invoked at critical steps in the processing of records, the receipt of keyboard strokes, and the receipt of mouse movements. Different triggers may be called before, during, and after each critical step.\\nEach trigger function is initially a stub, containing a default action or nothing. Programming Oracle Forms therefore generally consists of modifying the contents of these triggers in order to alter the default behavior. Some triggers, if provided by the programmer, replace the default action while others augment it.\\nAs a result of this strategy, it is possible to create a number of default form layouts which possess complete database functionality yet contain no programmer-written code at all.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOracle Forms is sold and released separately from the Oracle Database. However, major releases of an Oracle database usually result in a new major version of Oracle Forms to support new features in the database.\\n\\n\\n=== Interactive Application Facility (IAF) ===\\nOracle Forms started as Interactive Application Facility (IAF), which had two main components: the compiler (Interactive Application Generator - IAG) and the runtime interpreter (Interactive Application Processor - IAP). Released with the first Oracle Database version 2 (there was no version 1), IAF provided a character mode interface to allow users to enter and query data from an Oracle database.\\nIt was renamed to FastForms with Oracle Database version 4 and added an additional tool to help generate a default form to edit with IAG, the form editor.\\nIt was renamed a third time to SQL*Forms version 2 along with the Oracle 5 database version.\\n\\n\\n=== Forms 2.x ===\\nForms 2.0 included a forms design editor that included a screen painter.\\nThis release was character-based (rather than GUI) so forms were developed and runtime typically in a terminal.  The source file was an *.INP ASCII file and was edited using the screen painter, however the file was an ASCII file and editing this file directly in a text editor was a common practice due to the limitations of the form editor.\\nThis version of Forms did not include the PL/SQL language and instead it used its own custom language based on trigger steps.  The language was more primitive than the PL/SQL language that was available in SQL*Plus.  The limited language was augmented by user exits that compi',\n",
       "  \"announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company. The next day, on December 21, Oracle made public the acquisition of Federos, an AI and automation tools company for network performance. The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for $28.3 billion in cash. On March 31, 2020, Oracle announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire LiveData Utilities. The acquisition extends Oracle Utilities' Network Management System by adding a long-standing partner that provides leading operational technology (OT) middleware solutions and SCADA capabilities to monitor and control utility equipment while reducing the complexity of real-time systems.

       "  \"Oracle APEX (also known as APEX) is an enterprise low-code application development platform from Oracle Corporation. APEX is used for developing and deploying cloud, mobile and desktop applications. The platform is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with a range of features including wizards, drag-and-drop layout and property editors to simplify the process of building applications and pages.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nAPEX is currently a fully-supported no-cost feature of the Oracle Database and can be installed anywhere Oracle Database runs. APEX is also offered on Oracle's Cloud across various services including Autonomous Database Cloud Services and the stand-alone fully managed APEX Application Development service.Oracle APEX has had many name changes since its inception in 2000, including:\\n\\nFlows\\nOracle Platform\\nProject Marvel\\nHTML DB\\nApplication Express (APEX) aka Oracle APEXAPEX was created by Mike Hichwa a developer at Oracle, after the development of his previous project, WebDB, started to diverge from his original vision. Although APEX shares some functionality with Web DB, it was developed from scratch, and there's no upgrade path from Web DB to APEX. When tasked with building an internal web calendar, Hichwa enlisted the help of Joel Kallman and started development on a project called Flows. Hichwa and Kallman co-developed the Web Calendar and Flows, adding features to Flows as they needed them to develop the calendar. Early builds of Flow had no front-end, so all changes to an application had to be made in SQL*Plus via inserts, updates and deletes.APEX is extensively used internally by Oracle to develop its support sites. The AskTom knowledge base, online store, Dev Gym, and livesql run on APEX.With version 5.2, the numbering was changed to 18.1, indicating the year and quarter of release. This change is associated with Oracle's new numbering nomenclature. The latest version of the Oracle APEX application is 23.2 and was released on November 14, 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Low-code environment ==\\nWhile APEX has existed since 2004 in one form or another, it has recently been included in a new category of application development platforms called low-code. These low-code environments can trace their origins to 4GL programming languages and rapid application development (RAD) tools. Since APEX was originally marketed as a RAD tool, this progression is a logical one. APEX allows building web applications with no-code. When the requirements are more complex, APEX allows the extension of the Low-Code objects through a declarative framework. This framework lets the developer define custom logic, business rule, and user interfaces. The developer can do this through the inclusion of SQL, PL/SQL, HTML, JavaScript, or CSS as well as APEX plug-ins. APEX permits developers to go from no-code to low-code to more code.\\n\\n\\n== Security ==\\nThere is a common misconception that the abstracted nature of APEX applications results in a relatively secure user environment. However, APEX applications suffer from the same classes of application security flaws as other web applications based on more direct technologies such as PHP, ASP.net and Java.\\nThe main classes of vulnerability that affect APEX applications are: SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), and Access Control.\\nAPEX applications inherently use PL/SQL constructs as the base server-side language. As well as accessing data via PL/SQL blocks, an APEX application will use PL/SQL to implement authorization and to conditionally display web page elements. This means that generally APEX applications suffer from SQL injection when these PL/SQL blocks do not correctly validate and handle malicious user input. Oracle implemented a special variable type for APEX called Substitution Variables (with a syntax of &NAME) and these are not safe and lead to SQL Injection. Where the injection occurs within a PL/SQL block an attacker can inject an arbitrary number of queries or statements to execute. Es\",\n",
